          I will continue to support students who will move on to the 3rd year, this time in the <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=501685">Laboratory of Databases and Web Applications</a> (LBAW). This time I'll handle all the classes and all the students. It will certainly be another fun semester. My tasks:

          I helped 2nd year students during classes to develop drivers for computer peripherals following good low-level programming practices in the C language in the <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=501680">Laboratory Computing Course</a> (LCOM). Outside of classes I created the unofficial LCOM documentation, with explanations, exercises and a Template example for the final project that became life-saving for the students during the semester. It was a pleasure.
